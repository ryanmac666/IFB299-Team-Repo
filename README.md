## How to setup and run the django server
Django requires python (preferably python3 but python2 should work) and pip to install. Django can be installed with the following command
```shell
pip install Django==1.10.1
```
Next the servers dependencies need to be install. This can be done using the following commands
```shell
pip install django-bootstrap3
pip install django-notifications-hq
```
Now with the dependences installed the django server can be run from the CommunityOrganization folder by run the following command
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```
